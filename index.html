				<h1>For People Who Demand Better</h1>
			<p><em>Families need good health more than ever. </em>Real science. The best the<br> ingredients.the greater the taste.


Sounds simple, right? <br><br>Sure. But behind these simple concepts are years of scientific research,<br> innovation, 
and design. Areas that othercompanies take shortcuts in <br> but not us.<br><br>


That's why 70,000+ people made the switch to First Day.


Stop settling for <br>the sugar bombs disguised as vitamins. Or the outdated formulas filled<br> with unnecessary fillers.<br><br>


Demand better.</p>
